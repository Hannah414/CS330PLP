# CS-330 PLP C on Mac

C was created in the early 1970â€™s in Bell Labs by Dennis Richie. 
C was created in an effort to take advantage of PDP-11 features and improve upon the slowness of B, 
which was a modification of the BCPL created by Ken Thompson. 

C is a multipurpose programming language. 
A few examples of uses for C are databases, operating systems, kernels, 
and use as compilers/interpreters for other languages like perl or python. 

## Getting Started with C

### Resources

A few helpful resources for learning C are [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/c/index.php) and 
[programiz](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-recursion).

### Downloading C for Mac

We will be using Visual Studio Code, you can download VScode [here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Once you have finished downloading and installing VScode onto your computer
open the application and click on *extensions* located in the lefthand bar.
The symbol for it is 4 squares.

Once the *extensions* screen has popped out, use the search bar at the top of newly opened
screen and enter *C*.

The first result from your search should have a header of *C/C++* click on this hit install. 

After that has finished installing, you should go back to the search and also install the *C/C++ Extension Pack*. 

### Installing a Compiller for Mac

Mac has a compiller that is already availible for use called *Clang*. To use clang you will need to open up *Terminal*. Once *Terminal* is open enter and run the line **xcode-select --install**. When a pop-up window appears, hit **install**. Another pop-up window with the Terms and Conditions will appear, click on **agree**. Wait for Clang to finish installing. You can find more indepth instructions [here.](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/macclion/clang.html)
