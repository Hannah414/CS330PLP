# CS330PLP

C was created in the early 1970â€™s in Bell Labs by Dennis Richie. 
C was created in an effort to take advantage of PDP-11 features and improve upon the slowness of B, 
which was a modification of the BCPL created by Ken Thompson. 

C is a multipurpose programming language. 
A few examples of uses for C are databases, operating systems, kernels, 
and use as compilers/interpreters for other languages like perl or python. 

### Resources
