//here we include out header file that runs inputs and outputs 
#include <stdio.h>

//here we name and open a funtion in order to print "Hello World"
int main() {

   // printf() displays the string inside quotation
   printf("Hello, World!");

   // return is used to send data out from inside a function
   // there's nothing here the needs to be sent out, so we return 0
   // we will talk more about return late in the tutorial
   return 0;

// close the function
}
